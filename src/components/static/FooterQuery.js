        label: 'Terms of Use',
        content: 'ZED is a distributed application that runs on the Ethereum network, using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a "Smart Contract") to enable users to purchase, sell, breed and race, genetically unique digital thoroughbreds, which can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with and earn Ether from (the "Site"). The Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the "App". Using the App, users can view their thoroughbreds and use the Smart Contracts to purchase, sell, breed and race thoroughbreds through various means within the Site such as fixed price purchasing or via a clock based auction.<br>'+
            'ZED Pty Ltd ("ZED", "we", or "us") is making the App available to you.<br>'+
            'Before you use the App, the Smart Contracts, or the Site, however, you will need to agree to these Terms of Use and any terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference (collectively, these "Terms").<br>'+
            '<br>'+
            'PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE. THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE, UNLESS WE HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS. BY USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE SITE, OR ANY PART OF THEM, OR BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT" BELOW OR INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN AN ADJOINING BOX, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT ENTITY\'S BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE "YOU" WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE.<br>'+
            '1. Our Thoroughbreds<br>'+
            '2. We have utilized Smart Contracts to develop our initial generation of thoroughbreds ("ZED 1 to ZED 10 thoroughbreds"). We will release a certain number of ZED 1 to ZED 10 thoroughbreds into the marketplace and make them available for purchase to public before we launch the App. The purpose of making available the thoroughbreds before the App launches is to start creating a community of thoroughbred owners so that the App is more engaging on day ZED is launched. All unsold ZED 1 to ZED 10 thoroughbreds will be placed in ZED\'s "foundation farm" and be made available at an unspecified date in the future. ZED will release 38,000 thoroughbreds and will never, ever release any more thoroughbreds. For example, if only 20,000 thoroughbreds are sold before the launch of the App, 18,000 (total equals 38,000) thoroughbreds will be placed in the foundation farm and will be sold at an unspecified date in the future.  Thoroughbreds in the foundation farm may or may not be available to race or breed with.<br>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'All 38,000 thoroughbreds will be made available to the public to purchase before the App is officially launched. The 38,0000 thoroughbreds will be made available for purchase in stages. For example, 300 ZED 1\'s will be made for sale, then at the conclusion of the ZED 1 sale, the ZED 2\'s will be made available for sale.<br>'+
            '1. As users breed their thoroughbreds, new thoroughbred (offspring) ZED types will be created. Using the App\'s proprietary algorithm, each thoroughbred created from breeding will have a unique profile. Each offspring will carry over certain characteristics from its mother (mare) and its father (stallion) such as blood type and racing pedigree. The Smart Contracts the App has in place will have total control over the pseudo-random elements of the breeding process, which means that ZED or the App cannot manipulate or influence them.<br>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'How you breed your thoroughbreds is entirely up to each user. The only restrictions that we place are:<br>'+
            '1. a female (mare/filly) and male (stallion/colt) thoroughbred must mate together. Male to male thoroughbred and female to female thoroughbreds cannot breed together.<br>'+
            '2. Thoroughbreds cannot breed with brothers, sisters, parents or grandparents.<br>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'The gender outcome of each offspring is generated randomly and the offspring will always be owned by the female thoroughbred once the breeding transaction is complete.<br>'+
            '1. The App<br>'+
            'a.To most easily use the App, we strongly recommend that you first install the Google Chrome web browser. Once you have installed Chrome, you will need to install a browser extension called MetaMask. MetaMask is an electronic wallet, which allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than through MetaMask (or other Ethereum compatible browsers). The App will only recognize you as a user, and you will only be able to interact with the App, if your Ethereum electronic wallet is connected and unlocked through your MetaMask account. There is no other way to sign up as a user, or to interact directly with the App.<br>'+
            '2. Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.<br>'+
            '3. We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.<br>'+
            '4. You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an account for the App. By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete account information about yourself, and to maintain and promptly update as necessary your account information. You are responsible for the security of your account and your MetaMask wallet (and other Ethereum wallets and accounts). If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account with us, you agree to notify us immediately at race@zed.run.<br>'+
            '5. Fees and Payment<br>'+
            '   a.If you elect to purchase, sell, or breed thoroughbreds using the App, or with or from other users via the App, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network via MetaMask. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network or MetaMask.<br>'+
            '6. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a "Gas Fee") for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.<br>'+
            '7. In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a Smart Contract to conduct a transaction with another user via the App, you authorize us to collect a commission on certain events only (a "Commission"). These events include purchasing, selling or breeding of a thoroughbred on the App. The Commission value is xxx% of the total value of said event on the App. You acknowledge and agree that the Commission will be transferred directly to us through the Ethereum network as part of your payment. We will not collect a Commission for interactions that do not involve our App marketplace.<br>'+
            '8. As between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, "Taxes") associated with your use of the App (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, sale, or breeding of any of your thoroughbreds).<br>'+
            '<br>'+
            'Except for income taxes levied on ZED, you: (i) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (ii) shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms. You confirm that you are not a resident in Canada nor are you registered for Goods and services tax / Harmonized sales tax (GST / HST) or Provincial sales taxes (PST) in Canada, and will inform ZED if your status changes in the future. Need to understand this.<br>'+
            '<br/>'+
            '4 Ownership; Restrictions; Grant of License<br>'+

For the sake of clarity, you understand and agree:<br>'+
            '(i) that your "purchase" of a ZED thoroughbred, whether via the App or otherwise, does not give you any rights or licenses in or to the ZED Materials (including, without limitation, our copyright in and to the Art associated with that of ZED or the App) other than those expressly contained in these Terms;<br>'+
            '(ii) except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, that you do not have the right to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialize any elements of the ZED Materials (including, without limitation, our copyright in and to the Art associated with that thoroughbred) in any way without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold in our sole and absolute discretion; and<br>'+
            '(iii) that you will not apply for, register, or otherwise use or attempt to use any ZED or the Apps trademarks or service marks, or any confusingly similar marks, anywhere in the world without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold at our sole and absolute discretion.<br>'+
            '1. From time to time during your use of the App, you may elect to purchase one or more thoroughbreds (a "Purchased thoroughbred"). Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms (including, without limitation, the restrictions contained in this Section 4), ZED grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased thoroughbreds, solely for the following purposes:<br>'+
            '(i) for your own personal, non-commercial use;<br>'+
            '(ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase, sale and breeding of thoroughbreds, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each thoroughbred owners\' rights to display the Art for their Purchased thoroughbred to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or<br>'+
            '(iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of ZED, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each thoroughbred owners\' rights to display the Art for their Purchased thoroughbred to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased thoroughbred leaves the website/application.<br>'+
            '1. You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without ZED\'s express prior written consent in each case:<br>'+
            '(i) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased thoroughbreds;<br>'+
            '(ii) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Art for your Purchased thoroughbreds; or<br>'+
            '(vii) otherwise utilize the Art for your Purchased thoroughbreds for your or any third party\'s commercial benefit. To the extent that Art associated with your Purchased thoroughbreds contains third party intellectual property (e.g., licensed intellectual property from a celebrity or athlete) ("Third Party IP"), you understand and agree as follows:<br>'+
            '(iii) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the license and restrictions contained herein;<br>'+
            '(y) that, depending on the nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, ZED may need to pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use the Art; and<br>'+
            '(z) to the extent that ZED informs you of such additional restrictions in writing (email is permissible), you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of these Terms.<br>'+
            '1. The license granted in Section 4B applies only to the extent that you continue to own the applicable Purchased thoroughbreds. If at any time you sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Purchased thoroughbred for any reason, the license granted in Section 4B will immediately expire with respect to those thoroughbreds without the requirement of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for those thoroughbreds.<br>'+
            '2. You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about the App, including without limitation about how to improve the App (collectively, "Feedback"). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback at our discretion and without additional compensation to you, and to disclose such Feedback to third parties (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise). You hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide license under all rights necessary for us to incorporate and use your Feedback for any purpose.<br>'+
            '3. You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct while accessing or using the App, and for any consequences thereof. You agree to use the App only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with these Terms and any applicable laws or regulations.

If we delete your thoroughbreds profile from the App and/or the Site, such deletion will not affect your ownership rights in any thoroughbreds that you already own.<br>'+
            '1. Termination<br>'+
            'You may terminate these Terms at any time by cancelling your account on the App and discontinuing your access to and use of the App. You will not receive any refunds if you cancel your account, or otherwise terminate these Terms.

            '12. Assumption of Risk<br>'+
            'You accept and acknowledge each of the following:<br>'+
            '1.The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your thoroughbreds, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of thoroughbreds will not lose money.<br>'+
            '2.You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your thoroughbred related transactions. ZED is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.<br>'+
            '3.The App does not store, send, or receive thoroughbreds. This is because thoroughbreds exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App\'s supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network. Any transfer of ZED\'s thoroughbreds occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network, and not on the App.<br>'+
            '4.There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that ZED will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum network, however caused.<br>'+
            '5. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the ZED ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of ZED and your thoroughbred ownershipp.<br>'+
            '6.The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the ZED ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of your ZED thoroughbred.<br>'+
            '7.Upgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum platform, a hard fork in the Ethereum platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the ERC-20 standard, including the ZED ecosystem.<br>'+
            '<br><br>'+
            '1. Indemnification<br>'+
            'You agree to hold harmless and indemnify ZED and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any claim, liability, loss, damage (actual and consequential) of any kind or nature, suit, judgment, litigation cost, and attorneys\' fees arising out of or in any way related to:<br>'+

            '(ii) your misuse of the App, or<br>'+
            '(iii) your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with your access to or use of the App. You agree that ZED will have control of the defence or settlement of any such claims.<br>'+

Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you upon the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made available from, any External Sites.<br>'+
            '1. Changes to the Terms<br>'+
            'We may make changes to the Terms from time to time. When we make changes, we will make the updated Terms available on the App and update the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of these Terms accordingly. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Any changes to the Terms will apply on the date that they are made, and your continued access to or use of the App after the Terms have been updated will constitute your binding acceptance of the updates. If you do not agree to any revised Terms, you may not access or use the App.<br>'+
            '12 Changes to the App<br>'+
            'We are constantly innovating the App to help provide the best possible experience. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the App, and any part of it, may change from time to time without prior notice to you, and that we may add new features and change any part of the App at any time without notice.<br>'+

These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the province of British Columbia, Canada and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding its conflicts of law rules and principles. Subject to Section 15, any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or provincial courts located in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the parties irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue there.

            'ZED is hosted on Digital Ocean. Google data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards such as custom-designed electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors, and biometrics. According to the Google Security Whitepaper: “The data center floor features laser beam intrusion detection. Data centers are monitored 24/7 by high-resolution interior and exterior cameras that can detect and track intruders. Access logs, activity records, and camera footage are reviewed in case an incident occurs. Data centers are also routinely patrolled by professional security guards who have undergone rigorous background checks and training.” AWS data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards such as custom-designed electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors, and biometrics. According to the AWS Security Whitepaper: “AWS’s data centers are state of the art, utilizing innovative architectural and engineering approaches. Amazon has many years of experience in designing, constructing, and operating large-scale data centers. This experience has been applied to the AWS platform and infrastructure. AWS data centers are housed in nondescript facilities. Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security staff utilizing video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff must pass two-factor authentication a minimum of two times to access data center floors. All visitors and contractors are required to present identification and are signed in and continually escorted by authorized staff.” ZED employees do not have physical access to Google or AWS data centers, servers, network equipment, or storage.<br>'+

            'ZED is the assigned administrator of its infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform, and only designated authorized ZED operations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an as-needed basis behind a two-factor authenticated virtual private network. Specific private keys are required for individual servers, and keys are stored in a secure and encrypted location.<br>'+
            '<b>f. Penetration Testing</b><br>'+
            'We engage an independent, third-party agency to perform black box penetration testing on an annual basis. Information about security vulnerabilities that are successfully exploited through penetration testing is then used to set mitigation and remediation priorities.<br>'+
            '<b>g. Intrusion Detection and Prevention </b><br>'+
            'Unusual network patterns or suspicious behaviour are among ZED’s biggest concerns for infrastructure hosting and management. Google Cloud Platform’s intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) rely on both signature-based and algorithm-based security to help identify traffic patterns that are similar to known attack methods. IDS/IPS involves tightly controlling the size and make-up of the attack surface, employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points, and developing and deploying technologies that automatically remedy dangerous situations, as well as preventing known threats from accessing the system in the first place. We do not provide direct access to security event forensics, but we do provide access to our engineering and customer support teams during and after any unscheduled downtime.'

        label: 'NAKAMOTO',
        content: 'Few horse breeds are as unparalleled and sought after as the Nakamoto.  Although historians have yet to pinpoint their exact region of origin, this spectacular bloodline is rumored to have originated from Japan. While several theories have been proposed as to why this particular bloodline may have originated in the Land of the Rising Sun, none have been supported with any solid evidence.  However, it is no small wonder why so many experts believe they originated in the outskirts of Kyoto, as these horses are considered the Samurai of the thoroughbred world.<br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'Nakamotos are a true warrior breed with the ability to outrun any of their competitors, and with a bloodline that is considered to be the most rare and pure.  Their natural grace, noble frame, and high tail carriage lends them an air of pride and strength not often found in the horse racing arena.  Coupled with their striking colors of Ghost White, Midnight Black, and Absolute Zero, Nakamotos are the epitome of what a thoroughbred should be.  While they are used mostly for racing due to their speed and agility, their attractive and unique countenance has also made them a favorite for dressage and jumping.<br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'Nakamotos are also widely recognized for their personality and temperament.  High stamina, and the ability to learn quickly and almost intuitively, make them a highly coveted bloodline by both owners and trainers alike.  Their combination of endurance, intelligence, speed, purity, and aesthetics has made the Nakamoto the highest valued and most sought after bloodline in the world.  This coming after the fact that not quite a century ago, these magnificent horses were almost completely eradicated. <br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'For a period of several years, the Nakamotos were exposed to a parasite in the waters from the region in which they were almost exclusively being bred.  This parasite was thought to have originated due to a large increase in the water rat population outside of Kyoto at the time.  Exposure to this parasite caused the horses to suffer from palsy often followed by untimely deaths. While only a few horses were affected at first, it soon became an illness of epidemic proportions, and their numbers started dwindling at an alarming rate.  The Nakamotos continued to suffer from this ailment for some time until a renowned veterinary scientist, Dr. Hitoshi Sakura, was able to pinpoint the cause and administer an antidote. Breeders were then educated as to the best practices for feeding and watering their horses ensuring a safe and fruitful future for the Nakamoto.<br/>'+
            ' <br/>'+
            'Today, while the majority of Nakamotos are still being bred in Japan and regions of Southeast Asia, they can also be found in almost all corners of the world.   The horses continue to be carefully bred in order to ensure their purity.  Nakamoto offspring can only be created when two Nakamotos are coupled, and this purity of stock is strictly maintained by their breeders. This purity of breed is such that modern day Nakamotos closely mirror the physical attributes of their ancestors.'

        label: 'SZABO',
        content: 'The Szabo bloodline is considered second only to the Nakamoto in its purity and rarity of breed.  While gifted with a Hungarian name, this bloodline originates from the Hokkaido region of Japan where they are loved and revered for their beauty and strength. This appreciation has quickly spilled over into the racing world, where some of the most favored horses are direct descendants of the Szabo bloodline.<br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'While there is some speculation as to the validity of the claim, it is strongly believed that the Szabo was the first breed of thoroughbreds to race at a professional level.  Originally bred for pleasure riding, it soon became evident that these horses had much more to offer. Their keen abilities and impressive rapidity made them naturals on the racetrack.<br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'This masterful breed is well known for being the most intelligent, loyal, and adaptable. Coupled with a consistent temperament, these attributes make them a favored breed for trainers.  Amicable and intuitive, the Szabo also has a natural ability to take from their training and perform on the racetrack with ease and determination, making them a true force to be reckoned with.<br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'Outside of the thoroughbred racing arena, the Szabo is a particularly graceful breed and often admired for its fluid and graceful canter and movements.  With a smaller yet elegantly shaped head, muscular legs, thick coat, and iconic coloring such as Papaya Whip and White Smoke, these horses are a sight to behold. This is perhaps, why some breeders and owners have chosen to use their Szabos as show horses as well as racers. However, it is to be noted, that although this breed is aesthetically pleasing, it is also extremely sturdy. Having originated from Hokkaido where winters are known for their harshness and frigidity, the Szabo is able to withstand extremely cold temperatures and are known for not being afflicted by many of the ailments known to affect other breeds.<br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'While some equine historians believe the Szabo to have descended from the Nakamoto, this has yet to be proven and is considered anecdotal.  However, the two breeds are historically and closely linked as they have both been raised and bred in Japan for several centuries. Due to this geographical proximity, they have been natural competitors for as long as can be remembered.  Szabos are also often bred with Nakamotos to create new Szabo offspring.  Although Szabos are mainly bred within their bloodline, the crossbreeding with Nakamoto is said to occur in order to create more well defined withers and a higher tail carriage.'

        label: 'FINNY',
        content: 'The Finny bloodline is considered the third rarest breed, yet these horses are still able to consistently perform toe-to-toe with their top of the line competitors such as the Nakamotos.  This is a breed of horse that is hardworking, persevering, and uncharacteristically strong.  They are also purported as having a quirky and often unpredictable personality.   <br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'While quite intelligent, Finnys can sometimes be difficult to train as they tend to be headstrong and particular about their trainers.  However, once past this occasional issue, the Finny can be extremely adaptable and keen to learn.  It is often thought that this wide range of characteristics and personality traits is attributed to the heavy practice of inbreeding since the origin of the bloodline.  Present day breeding of the Finny has incorporated mating between it and Nakamotos or Szabos in order to dilute some of the more challenging character traits.  This practice has proven to be working very successfully.<br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'When it comes to physical appearance and structure, the Finny is a basic, yet handsome horse.  These horses are known for their musculature, straight necks, firm hooves, and flexible legs.  Their naturally lustrous coats are recognized for their deep shades of hazel, rust, chestnut, and black.  The typical Finny mane is also notably different than that of other bloodlines. Rather than a long and flowing mane and tail, this breed exhibits ones that are thinner and shorter.  As a result, the Wright has quickly become a favorite amongst groomers for their ease of care and management.<br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'Finnys are currently bred across Europe and North America, however, their origins lie in the Middle East.  It is said that the Finny’s genetics may be traced as far back as the Karabakh and Royal Persian horse breeds.<br/>'+
            'To this day, the highest priced Finnys are to be found in the Arabian Peninsula region near the Gulf of Oman. <br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'These horses in particular, although bred as meticulously as their European and American counterparts, tend to have a more in-depth resiliency and endurance. They have, over the years shown an ability to survive in unpleasant environments, and with little to no resources. This is often attributed to the extreme heat and weather conditions they are raised in.  Traits such as these translate well when it comes to the grit and strength of character needed in order to succeed on the racetrack, especially amongst competitors who are naturally more rapid and agile.<br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'The Finny is a determined, and naturally competitive horse.  While not as highly coveted as a Nakamoto, or Szabo, this breed has found itself a permanent place in the world of horse racing due to its tenacity and endurance. It will be of no surprise if we continue to see and hear more of these horses and their successes in the near future.'

        label: 'WRIGHT',
        content: 'Originating from Australia, the Wright bloodline is known to be the most common breed of thoroughbred.  Easily bred, these horses are naturally healthy, sturdy, quick on their feet, and virtually effortless to train. Not surprisingly, over 25% of the total thoroughbred population is said to be directly descended from this bloodline. <br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'Despite the fact that the Wright bloodline is one of the newest to be introduced to the horse racing arena, they have fast become a favorite amongst racing aficionados.  The Wright performs exceedingly well on the track, yet manages to maintain a gentle nature and a great willingness to learn and obey its trainers.  Out of all the thoroughbred breeds, this one is most famous for its ability to understand visual and sound commands from both trainer, and rider.  This allows for a horse that is predictable, undemanding, extremely manageable, and easy to bet on.  Wright horses deliver consistent results time and time again.<br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'Raised mainly in the Australian Outback, these horses are used to rugged terrain and arid temperatures making them sturdy and easily adaptable to dryer conditions. They can stay in the sun with minimal water for long periods of time, track for many miles a day, and are well versed in running on rocky ground. It is rumored that Wrights were originally bred as farm and pack horses, yet their speed made them transition easily into racing.  Aside from racing, these horses are also often seen in the jumping arena, as their athletic frame and strong legs lend well to either sport.<br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'The Wright is often compared to saddle and harness horse breeds as they display the same strength and endurance.  They are naturally speedy, sturdy, and alert, and often used for training younger riders due to their patient and amicable temperament.  Wrights have basic yet strong body contours. While not being show horses, they are impressive to look at due to their thick necks, and broad chests and backs.  They have large, clear hazel eyes, and are known for short coats of gray, black, and on the rare occasion, pure white.<br/>'+
            '<br/>'+
            'While still mainly bred in Australia, there are now several areas in the American Southwest where Wrights are licensed to breed, as well as in the Tuscan region of Italy, and Provence, France. The popularity of this pleasant and hardworking horse continues to grow as will their numbers on the track. This is one breed not to be underestimated.'
