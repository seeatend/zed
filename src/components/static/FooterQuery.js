ZED uses different statistics to measure value; race starts, race wins, bloodline, bloodline of the parents and how far from their ancestors all contribute to defining the value of a thoroughbred.  \n' +

            'If you own a female thoroughbred, you can shop around the Stud Farm to find your ideal partner.  The choice to breed rests with the female thoroughbred.  If the female thoroughbred likes what she sees, she can pay the breeding fee and the offspring is hers to keep!\n' +

The selling process works similar to that of a real auction where users have a limited time to bid on your thoroughbred.  The highest bidder at the end of the auction is the one who gets to keep your thoroughbred, and you get to keep the funds!\n' +

Eight thoroughbreds are selected at random for every race to ensure that the ZED community grows together, equally and fairly.  However, every race will have four \'buy-in\' options if you cannot contain your excitement!\n' +
            'Races are split into Group A, B and C where Group A races are the most prestigious and add the most value to your thoroughbred if it is lucky enough to race in. \n' +
